## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Coarse 4-phase structure — Foundation, Agent Execution, UI+Tamir, Workspace+Integration
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 flagged as hardest — validation spike recommended before full implementation
- [Phase 01]: Prisma 7 requires prisma.config.ts for datasource URL -- url removed from schema.prisma
- [Phase 01]: driverAdapters no longer a preview feature in Prisma 7.5 -- flag removed
- [Phase 01]: PrismaBetterSqlite3 adapter takes {url} config in Prisma 7 -- separate sqlite instance for FTS5 raw access
- [Phase 01]: Prisma camelCase column names in raw SQL -- no @map() overrides in schema
- [Phase 01]: SSEEventBus wraps typed emissions into {type, data} envelope on unified event channel
- [Phase 01]: Junction symlinks for workspace skill sharing (cross-platform compatible)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: SDK subprocess model with per-invocation MCP servers needs spike validation before full build
- [Phase 3]: Tamir routing structured output schema design may benefit from research during planning
